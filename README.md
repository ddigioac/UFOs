# UFO Analysis

## Overview of the UFO Analysis

### Purpose

In this analysis I have created a webpage and dynamic table for users to filter multiple criteria (date, city, state, country and shape) in order to examine UFO sighting data. 

## UFO Results

In order to perform a search on the webpage, the user must scroll to the 'Filter Search' section on the left hand side of the page. 

Within 'Filter Search', users can input a date (ex. 1/1/2010), city (ex. benton), state (ex. ar), country (ex. us), and shape (ex. circle). As per image below:

Users may also search by entering data in only field. For example, I entered the state as 'ca' to search for all UFO sighting data in California. See image below:

## UFO Summary

One drawback of the new design webpage, is that the user has to refresh the page every time they would like to start a new search. Two recommendations for further development would include creating a button to refresh the search fields and reset the data, and to include more data outside of just the United States. Since we have a search field that allows us to search via country, it would make sense to have multiple countries data.
